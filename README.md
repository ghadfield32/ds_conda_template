# Machine Learning Project Template

This project template is designed for machine learning projects, providing a structured setup for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>

    Create the Conda environment:

    bash

conda env create -f environment.yml

Activate the environment:

bash

conda activate yolo_env

Run the Streamlit app:

bash

    streamlit run app/app.py

Basic Commands

    Deactivate the environment:

    bash

conda deactivate

Remove the environment:

bash

conda env remove --name yolo_env

Update the environment (after changing environment.yml):

bash

    conda env update --file environment.yml --prune

Cleanup

To remove the Conda environment when you are done:

bash

conda env remove --name yolo_env

Kernel Insertion:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda env list
conda install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name breast-cancer-pred --display-name "Python (breast-cancer-pred)"


Project Structure

    data/: Contains raw and processed data
    notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
    src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training
    app/: Streamlit app for model deployment
    tests/: Unit tests
